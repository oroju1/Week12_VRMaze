# Week12_VRMaze: Build a maze in VR

For my VR maze, I chose to make it zombie-themed. I used resources and prefabs from the Toony Tiny People Asset Package and the Snaps prototype package. I built a maze with several turns with the help of Pro Grids to snap pieces into place. I included two locked doors in the maze to serve as obstacles. The player is able to move through each door after they find the correct colored keys.  These keys have an attachment so that they are picked up in the correct orientation. At the end of the maze the player finds Officer Johnson. In regards to the controllers, I included a teleport locomotion function on the left hand controller and grip functionality on the right hand controller for picking up items. I utilized the XR Interaction toolkits starter asset package for default controller settings and customized the trigger and the grip buttons for selections. I included a Snap Turn Provided as well to allow the user to use the joysticks to turn in 45 degree increments. I added teleportation areas on all the floors for navigation. For the characters, I included some animation controllers to bring the scene to life a bit. Specifically, I utilized box colliders and OnTriggerEnter events to play animations. I also included sound effects, visual aids with Text Mesh Pro and music to create a more immersive experience.
